    Your code will receive two variables, *a* and *b*. Compute their sum and
    assign it to *c*.

#    import random

#    a = random.uniform(-10, 10)
#    b = random.uniform(-10, 10)
     a = 160
     b = 80

        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed c is not a float.")

    correct_c = a + b
    rel_err = abs(correct_c-c)/abs(correct_c)

    if rel_err < 1e-7:
