    Your code will receive two variables, *height* and *weight*. Compute their sum and
    assign it to *bmi* and *fatness*.

setup_code: |
    import random

    height = random.uniform(150, 200)
    weight = random.uniform(40, 100)

names_for_user: [height, weight]

names_from_user: [bmi, fatness]

test_code: |
    if not isinstance(bmi, float):
        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed bmi is not a float.")

    if not isinstance(fatness, int):
        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed fatness is not a integer.")

    height_cm = height / 100
    correct_bmi = weight / (height_cm * height_cm)

    rel_err1 = abs(correct_bmi-bmi)/abs(correct_bmi)

    if rel_err < 1e-7:
        feedback.finish(1, "Your computed c was correct.")
    else:
        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed c was incorrect.")
